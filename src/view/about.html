    <p>This tool provides the following functionality:
      <ul>
        <li>Add hashtags, organized by favorite and categories</li>
        <li>Get a number of random hashtags for a category (favorite hashtags are with priority)
          <br/>
          <small>e.x. You have 20 hashtags (10 of them marked as favorite) under category 'Personal'.
            <br/>From the <b>Home</b> page, you want 15 hashtags from that category in which case you will get
            the 10 favorite hashtags and 5 of the 10 non-favorite hashtags in a random order.
          </small>
        </li>
        <li>Copy those hashtags to clipboard for ease of use and edit them</li>
        <li>You can export all of your categories with hashtags as a JSON file and you can import them back</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <small><i><b>Simple Hashtag Manager uses your browser's LocalStorage to store your hashtags data which means that if you clear your browser's data
      you will lose all of your hashtags in this app!
      <br/>To be safe, make sure to use the 'export' button in the 'Home' page to export your data as a file that you can keep and later import
      in Simple Hashtag Manager.
